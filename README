=================

My kid has a little moon nightlight, but we keep misplacing the remote
control for it.  This is a trivial clip that holds it; you may need to
modify it to suit your needs.  In particular, it doesn't have a
mounting hole.  I melted one into mine using a hot air gun and a
screw, then used a countersink bit to make room for the screw head.

You probably want to load it by slipping it in from the top, but it
does have the angled bits to accept it by shoving it in.  It's just a
bit fragile for that.

Released into the public domain, assuming it was even copyrightable in
the first place.
